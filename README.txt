Hello everyone! 

This is my first personal website ever! Although it is not perfect, I learned a lot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the final product. I implemented a coverflow-style gallery which you can rotate through and hover over images to see descriptions.
Have fun by playing hangman and tic tac toe as well!

I hope you enjoyed it!
